This project focuses on computational drug repurposing for Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare but highly fatal infection caused by Naegleria fowleri. The work involves identifying potential therapeutic candidates by performing molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding energy calculations.
The repository includes the workflow used to screen repurposed drugs, analyze protein–ligand interactions, evaluate structural stability, and compute binding affinity using MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA methods. This project demonstrates my skills in computational biology, docking, MD simulations, and bioinformatics-driven drug discovery.
